This is an installer for Rails applications. It's designed to allow users to
install Rails apps onto their own systems with a minimum amount of effort.

This installer was originally part of Typo (http://typosphere.org).

= Adding the installer to your Rails app

To add the installer to your application, cd to your application's directory
and run 'rails-app-installer-setup APPNAME'. This will create several files,
including 'bin/APPNAME' and 'lib/tasks/release.rake'. Edit these files to make
sure that they're appropriate for your application and then add them to your
revision control system.

You should now be able to test the installer like this:

    $ ruby ./bin/my_installer install /tmp/foo cwd

This will try to install your app in `/tmp/foo` using the current directory as
a template. If you leave off the `cwd` option at the end, then the installer
will look for the most recent Ruby GEM for your app, using the
`application_name` line from the installer as the gem name.
